Use data collected from Peter McKeever's openfootball.club (See the shot_map repository for directions on how to use openfootball.club to collect data) to create an xG plot.

What I use these for:
- Breaking down a team's offensive production over time.
- Showing our players periods of time during the game where we performed well or poorly.
- Opposition analysis. For example in this plot, Colorado College had 1 shot (0.10 xg) between the 30' and 65' so a coach could focus on those 35 minutes of the game and see what
defensive tactics are effective against CC.
